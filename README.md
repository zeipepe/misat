#Music Instrument Statistic Analysis Tool

Based in react-player's demo this app is intended to manually save how much of a role an instrument plays in a song by ear.

##Usage
1) Load a url and hit play
2) While the song plays hit a key that represents the instrument playing. You can choose as many instruments as you want. Statistics are currently displayed by instrument.
